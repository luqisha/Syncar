## Syncar
Syncar is a distributed vehicle registration system that was made as a project for CSE4126: Distributed Database Systems Lab. This has been made in _Oracle 10g_ using _PL/SQL_.

There are two sites to simulate two database locations. Each site holds vehicle data for some predefined locations that is obtained during the registration of a vehicle. To run the project, you will need two systems with Oracle 10g, both connected by a network. Or a virtual machine on a system to simulate the second site.
